## Hypothesis:
* **The core message of our group is to analyze and visualize the survey done on Happiness Score data for the past three years and to understand how the key factors are related to the Happiness Score of 156 countries.**

* **And to understand if there is any relationship between  Happiness Score and Human Development Index (HDI) of these countries.**


## Data Source:
* **World Happiness survey data is from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com]**
* **Human Development Index(HDI) API was taken from [http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-report-office-statistical-data-api]**


## Compelling questions found for this analysis:
#### 1) How does happiness score depend on different demographic factors i.e. GDP/ Economy, Health & Corruption?

**Analysis:**
* Happiness score is strongly related to GDP based off of r-value.
* Happiness score is strongly related to Health based off of r-value.
* Happiness score increases as GDP & Health increases.
* Happiness score is not related to corruption based off of r-value. Looks like people are not that much concern about corruption.
* Corelation of GDP, Health to happiness score is almost same across last 3 years.

* For top 5 countries in year 2018 & 2019 there is not much differnce between Health & GDP demographics
